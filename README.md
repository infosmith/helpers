# Helpers

Utilities generalizable enough to be extracted from projects into a collection
but not yet sufficient to warrant separate projects. Collections of utilities
thought likely to warrant individual projects at some point are organized into
Helpers packages until their value warrants factoring out the collection into
separate projects. In other words, this is a collection of pip installable gists.
